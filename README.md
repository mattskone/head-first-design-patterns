## Head First Design Patterns
---

#### Introduction
I'm a big fan of the book _Head First Design Patterns_ (Eric Freeman & Elisabeth Freeman, O'Reilly Press, 2004). The purpose of this project is to attempt to implement the design patterns explained in the book using the Python programming language.

#### Contributions
I'm not the smartest guy in the room - not by a long shot - but I'd like this to be a useful resource for anyone learning Python or Object-Oriented design patterns (or both!). Feel free to fork this project for your own use (subject to the MIT license - see the enclosed license file), and if you see a better (especially, a more "Pythonic") way to implement the patterns, please send me a pull request.
